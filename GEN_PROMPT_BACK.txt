You are generating the ENTIRE backend codebase for BacKRoom-back.

# Must-Haves
- Node.js 20 + TypeScript + Express
- Folders: src/config, src/common, src/modules/{auth,users,files,i18n,admin}, src/db, src/docs
- MySQL with mysql2/promise; env-driven configuration
- Auth with JWT access (<=15m) + refresh (httpOnly cookie, 7â€“30d); rotation + reuse detection
- Forgot/Reset password via SMTP; Mailpit in dev
- Files: S3 presigned PUT/GET; confirm metadata; enforce owner checks
- i18n: fetch by `locale` & `namespace` from DB; in-memory cache + ETag
- Admin: users (role/disable), translations, flags, audit logs
- Validation: Zod/Joi; Helmet; CORS allowlist from `FRONTEND_ORIGIN`
- Rate limiting; structured logs; `/api/health`, `/api/ready`
- OpenAPI at `/docs` (dev only)
- Dockerfile (multi-stage) and docker-compose.yml (already provided here) must work

# Contract with Frontend
- All API paths are under `/api`
- CORS must allow origin from `FRONTEND_ORIGIN`
- Set secure cookie flags appropriately (dev vs prod) for refresh token

# Provide
- Complete source files with real implementations (no placeholders)
- Scripts in package.json for dev/build/start
- README snippet: how to run locally and in Docker
